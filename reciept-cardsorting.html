<p>The world and it’s <em>politics are not inert,</em> they are dynamic and changing. Escobar argues that based on an ontological design approach, design has to move beyond the artifacts have politics understanding of design, which poses design as “hard wiring” politics into material.</p>

<aside>
Arturo Escobar argues a similar fact later on in the book that we are reading. Making a longer statement about this or that.

<p>Here is some more text that we’ve written out to describe what it is that is going on right here. Some of this is for people to read and others is not really for reading as much</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For so long we have expected the design professions to bend an inert world into shape. The alternative is to try to gently catalyze the self-designing potentialities of nature.</p>

<p>Here is a lot more text that I want to write to describe the thing that is being described right here.</p>
